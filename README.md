# SpotterLevel3
Feeds APRS data into GRLevel3 via custom placefiles to allow tracking of Skywarn spotters.

1. Add the call signs you want to track to the roster
2. their locations are retrieved from [aprs.fi](https://aprs.fi) (you'll need to create a free API key)
4. use GRLevel3's Placefile Manager to add the place file generated by SpotterLevel3
5. SpotterLevel3's embedded web server generates up-to-date place files on-demand

This is being developed for the [Saint Cloud Amateur Radio Club](https://w0sv.club) (W0SV) which operates Central Minnesota Skywarn. I dont know if this will be useful to other clubs or Skywarn organizations but you're welcome to try it out.
