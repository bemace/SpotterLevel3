# SpotterLevel3
Feeds [APRS](http://www.aprs.org/) data into [GRLevel3](http://www.grlevelx.com/grlevel3_2/) via custom placefiles to allow tracking of [Skywarn](https://www.weather.gov/SKYWARN) spotters.

## How it works
1. Add the call signs you want to track to the roster
2. their locations are retrieved from [aprs.fi](https://aprs.fi) (you'll need to create a free API key)
4. use GRLevel3's Placefile Manager to add the place file generated by SpotterLevel3
5. SpotterLevel3's embedded web server generates up-to-date place files on-demand

This is being developed for the [Saint Cloud Amateur Radio Club](https://w0sv.club) (W0SV) which operates Central Minnesota Skywarn. I dont know if this will be useful to other clubs or Skywarn organizations but you're welcome to try it out.

## Requirements

* Java 11.

## Setup

* Enter your aprs.fi API key on the settings screen
